Darkened Dark Glass Popup Menu hover property.
Added Dark Glass color scheme to notifications and modal dialogs (May not show with Cinnamon 1.20, but works with Cinnamon compiled from the latest source from github).
Standardized the hover color scheme for Menu Favorite buttons and the various panel buttons.
Various other tweaks in the color scheme to match the various elements of the theme.
